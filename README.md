# Scenes for a play.

Something put together over 3 weeks during free time after work. To be used as scenes for a play. 
The director wanted clouds, a landscape, and some water... 
He also wanted birds and other things, but I didn't have time to complete that ``and`` 
provide the authoring tools he needed to sequence the transisions.
